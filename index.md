## Short Bio



## Research Interests

I am interested in understanding and controlling the fundamental poro-mechanical processes that determine the formation and recovery of earth resources from sedimentary rocks to achieve energy and environmental sustainability. At present, my research is focused on formulating innovative theories and developing advanced numerical methods to investigate the **multi-scale** pore structures, **multiple** fluid flow patterns, and complex **multi-physics** processes. Additionally, I am exploring the effects of bedding-induced **anisotropy**. This comprehensive investigation is aimed at facilitating a transition towards sustainable energy practices, and our results should be applicable to general porous media with slight modifications. By integrating rock experimental testing data (such as the poroelasticity constants) with poromechanics and solid mechanics theory, my team and I aim to build predictive models that can enhance our understanding of shale behavior and contribute to more efficient and sustainable energy extraction practices.
